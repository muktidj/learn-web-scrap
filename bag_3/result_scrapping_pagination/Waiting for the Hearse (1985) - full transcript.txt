She must be hungry, I'll make her a feeding bottle. No, Mom. Her last one was half an hour ago. - Where are you going? - She must be nervous. Want me to give her a teaspoon of linden tea? No, don't give her anything. Don't give her anything! Just put the pacifier in her mouth and leave her. But, Susana, you know that if I stuck it into her mouth... she spits it out. She does that all the time. Know something... it may be your milk. See? You are too strung up of late. How come you see me nervous? Jorge, check if she's soiled herself. - She has! - Could you change her diapers? No! I've told you I don't like to do that. - Oh, then I'll do it. - No! No. You stay here. Here! I'll go. Big deal, changing a diaper, you'd say. Susana, do you want me to do anything? Can I help you out? No, don't! Why don't you sit down and read the newspaper! Don't say that to her. You make her feel useless. I'd rather she stayed still. This must be for making flan. Oh, crybaby, Mummy was making dinner. Here, take this to the bathroom and be careful not to drop anything. I leave, and you start crying. - Can you iron, Jorge? - You know that if I do... ...I'll burn myself. - I'll do it, Susana. I'm not speaking to you, Mama Cora. - Where did I put the pin? - Oh, be careful! Oh, don't you move, my angel, don't move. It's gone. I don't see it. - take another one, from the closet. - the closet, the closet. Why do you ask me? You know I don't know anything. Oh, so learn! From inside the closet. Inside, inside, but, where? Oh, Jorge, don't make me yet more nervous! Don't do this, don't do that, as if I was useless. I can't even touch the little kid. this feels like a rock. Oh God! It needs some sugar. Look, noodles, she has it all mixed up. - And this, what is this? - Your mother's. As we starve her to death, she hides her food under the pillow. - Here's the pin. - Well, let her help you. - She's not useless. She's not crazy. - Isn't she?! Well, darling, take it easy. Now, let's get some sleep. till your next bottle, ok? - Shall we put her in the stroller? - Are you asking me? My other husbands are not available now. - Who do you want me to ask! - Eh, how should I know? - You feed the baby omelet? - No! Your mother hid it, those are leftovers from last night. that's why this room smells bad. - Smells, how? - Don't you have a nose? Don't you smell, as I do? It smells of rotten food! - So, is she asleep? - Almost. - What happened? - Where? With the mayonnaise. What? that was mayonnaise? - Where's the mayonnaise? - I thought that... What did you think? - Didn't look like mayonnaise, Susana. - What have you done to my mayonnaise?! Flan. You talked about making flan last night. You heard her, Jorge. Was she or wasn't she going make flan? Mom! Four eggs, liters of oil... - Wait. ...liters of milk, salt... - Wait. ...mustard, and surely tons of sugar, all wasted! Oh! Why would you do that, mom? Didn't look like mayonnaise, Jorge. You can't do anything without asking first! And stay put! Don't move! Didn't look like mayonnaise! Wait, where are you going? Wait! Wait! Wait, where are you going? - Matilde, the phone is ringing! - Don't you know she's sleeping? You go get it! - today is my resting day. - I'd like to know when mine is. Hello. Yes. No, no Pirula here. And answer the phone if it rings! - I won't move from this couch. - Hey, hey, hey. I never get a break and I don't make such a big deal of it, ah? I would have liked to stay in bed until 11.
